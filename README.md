In this repo I will try to write some test cases for a simple todo list react app that I found on github.

The original blog page is https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-todo-list-with-react-hooks-ebaa4e3db3b/

The original github repo url is https://github.com/yazeedb/react-hooks-todo

In my github repo I have included some tests to test that this ToDoList App is working correctly using the react testing library.


After cloning the project, we need to install the dependencies

`
npm install
`

Run the tests

`
npm test
`

Take a look at src/App.test.js and you will find the following test cases:

- renders App without crashing
- renders TodoForm without crashing
- able to add a todo task
- able to delete a todo task
